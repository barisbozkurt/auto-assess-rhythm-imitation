This folder contains the following files:

Annotation files for the MAST RHYTHM data set available at https://zenodo.org/record/2620357#.Y1bLpnVBwW1 :
'annotations_0.zip': Grades by Expert 0 (most experienced, conservatory. prof. )
'annotations_1.zip': Grades by Expert 1 (graduate conservatory student)
'annotations_2.zip': Grades by Expert 2 (graduate conservatory student)

'manuallyCorrectedOnsets.zip': Manully corrected onsets files. Preparation procedure: 
ODFs were plotted together with onset locations for visual inspection. Following visual 
inspection, a group of files for which a mis-placement is likely, manual correction was 
performed(by undergrad. engineering students) using Audacity modifying the onset times. 
This package contains the manually modified onset data.

'train_couples.txt' and 'test_couples.txt': fixed set of train and test couples. To 
create a new random set you could use the convert_annotations.py script in the 
data_processing folder

rhythm_data4ML_full_agree_correctedOnsets.zip: Tabular ML data created using files for 
which all annotators assigned the same grade.

Audio files are not included in the data folder due to size constraints. You could use 
downloadAudioFromZenodo.py that downloads all audio data from Zenodo and converts .m4a
files to .wav files. This would place all resulting files in data/wav folder
