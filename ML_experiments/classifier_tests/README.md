# Exemplary automatic classification test

In our study, we have considered the assessment problem as a regression problem. It is also possible to consider it as a classification problem.

In this folder we present an exemplary jupyter notebook that runs tests with tabular data created using the data processing tools. Since classification is not our focus we simply provide tests using a Random Forest classifier with default settings in the scikit-learn package.
